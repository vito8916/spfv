                    Although this Website is informational only and does not

                    solicitation for investment, you should be aware of the inherent
                    risks of investment. There are risks associated with investing
                    in securities. Investing in stocks, bonds, exchange traded
                    funds, mutual funds, and money market funds involve risk of
                    loss. Loss of principal is possible. Some high risk investments
                    may use leverage, which will accentuate gains & losses. Foreign
                    investing involves special risks, including a greater volatility
                    and political, economic and currency risks and differences in
                    accounting methods. A security’s or a firm’s past investment
                    performance is not a guarantee or predictor of future investment
                    performance.
